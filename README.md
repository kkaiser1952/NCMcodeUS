Net Control Manager (NCM) is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application designed to facilitate the management and logging of Amateur radio nets. When NCM is launched via index.php, the primary interface opens, providing users with a streamlined selection of options. Users can initiate a new net by clicking the 'Start a New Net' button, access archived nets by selecting 'Browse a Net by Number,' or quickly open a recent net from the dropdown menu labeled 'Or Select From Past 10 Days Nets.'

Users typically fall into two categories: observers and active control operators. Observers monitor net activities in real time, following station check-ins handled by the Net Control Station (NCS) and/or the logging station, which records most entries. In some cases, a single individual may fulfill both roles.

Previously, observers had to manually set a refresh timer (typically 5 or 10 seconds) to update their screens to track net activities. In the upcoming version of NCM, this will be improved by implementing Server-Sent Events (SSE), eliminating the need for manual refresh timers and ensuring real-time updates. SSE updates are strictly limited to the net's main data table, which consists of rows representing stations involved in the net and columns containing various details about those stations. This ensures that other interactive elements, such as the 'Start a New Net' form, remain unaffected by automatic updates.

Additionally, the application is undergoing significant backend upgrades. The MySQL queries, originally written for version 5.5, are being optimized for version 8.0. Similarly, the PHP version will be updated from an outdated release to a modern 8.x iteration, improving overall performance and security.

One key aspect of NCM is its open-access design it does not require users to log in or provide credentials to access its features. This makes the system easily accessible to amateur radio operators worldwide. This is a considerations regarding safety particularly for operators in the field, much more about this in the help file.
